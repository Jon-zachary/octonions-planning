Project 1 Rubric:
  - A game written in JavaScript that renders in the browser. 
  - The game should be OO and at the minimum have a 'player' class and a 'game' class. 
  - The functions involved should be ~10 lines and be well commented. (Maybe make a separate section for style aims)
  - The CSS should be class based (Do we want to mandate Grid and/or flexbox?)
  - The game logic and state should be kept in JavaScript data structures unless HTML data- attributes are justified.
  - All collision detection must be array/gird based. (We can leave a loophole here for special pleading)
  - Game must be deployed. (Should we mandate GH pages? Maybe let them use surge if that's going to be used for react)
  - There must be some concept of wining and losing. 
  - Code must be linted
  - Game must have a readme that includes planning materials as well as technologies used, code snippet, challenges and plans for further development.

Planning materials
  - Wireframes that reflect the *final* app.
  - User stories(can we call these feature lists or maybe do a better job at being rigorous about what we mean)
  - Clear description of the game, win/loss conditions controls etc.
  - priority matrix(if we do this we need to devote in class time to explaining it)

Workflow
  - There must be a git history starting at the begging of your project and going until the end. You must have *at least* (2?) commits per day
  - Your planning materials must be updated to reflect the final state of your app.
  - You must communicate with your project lead daily and respond to all communications. Further you must be prepared to accept feedback and willing to change course if necessary.

Post MVP:
  - Accessability(I think we need to be hitting this harder)
  - CSS animations/transitions.
  - Easter eggs (Konami code etc)
  - Local storage for high scores etc.
  - AI if applicable


So, given the above how should we restructure unit 1? We have a good record of our unit 1 in the [Lambda wiki](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-lambda/lambda-class-info/wiki)

Many things must be done in order. For instance we need to teach the command line before we teach git etc.
So I'm not sure how much flexibility we have for the first two day. 

10/9/18 - Tue - Install fest, command line and git. This is always an annoying day to plan because so much depends on how install fest goes. Is there someway to timebox it so we can triage the problems without stopping the overall class?

Also I want to start a little slower this time. While I think a lot of the meet and greet stuff is razzle dazzle I want to spend more time on class room culture and expectations. Let's use the get to know you time better. I also kind of like the 'draw a quote' exercise more than the person bingo. Let's also think about better exercises.

Morning:
So what if we take until 11:00 to do get to know you/us/classroom expectations. Then we have an hour and a half for install fest. That feels doable. Is there a way to stagger it so we don't break the internet?

Afternoon:
Can we do both terminal and git? If we can talk about both of them as skills that we are going to continue to improve throughout the class but are necessary to get started. What's the minimum terminal commands they need to start. mkdir, touch, cd, ls, rm, mv, cp? Maybe we can have the lesson center around creating a class directory structure for the week?
If we do quotes in the morning and leave them on the wall we can have them touch a md file and write they're top 10 five quotes or something. Let's say that goes until 3:00

What does basic git in an hour and a half look like? I think we should have them go through the hw workflow multiple times. Again if we do a learn some facts about your classmates  we can have them fork/clone (3?) repos, one for each classmate and enter in some facts or something and then make a pr on them. Then first night hw is one of those terminal things, starwars or w/e. Maybe also EJS chap 0?

Before they leave every day a generic exit ticket and pairs for the next day

10/10/18 - Wed - Typing.io, intro JS, Basic dev stuff? 

9-10 Typing.io send screenshot and record scores. Let's keep outcomes on Wednesdays so this will be intro to outcomes. How long is that? I feel like it's shortish. Maybe gives us times to hit dev hygiene but not talk about JS. Tonight they read chap 1-2 of EJS and answer questions on google form? Maybe postpone outcomes so we can intro JS and actually have them do a real hw.

10/11/18 - Thur - JS data types, control flow, functions - depends on Wed.
9- 10 pair programing pseudo code lab. Think like a programmer. Maybe less 'peanut butter sandwich' and more actual programm-y stuff. 

10:00 - 12:30 - data types, bindings
1:30 - 4:30 - control flow, functions ?
hw: EJS questions? Fizzbuzz, countByEvens etc.

10/12/18 - Fri - Functions, Node, write your first game?
9 - 10: whiteboard in their pairs. 
10:00 - 12:30 Functions, debugging in node shell.
1:30 - 4:30 Write a console game. 
Weekend hw: ?
